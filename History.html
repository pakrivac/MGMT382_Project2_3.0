        <font color="#0c343d"><font size="+1"><p>In 1978, Harry and Harriet launched their dream on a stretch of open land, armed with just a couple of hang gliders and an unyielding passion for the skies. Their weekends were dedicated to teaching the art of hang gliding, transforming their small outpost into a revered haven for adventurers and dreamers alike. Their philosophy of freedom and flight drew enthusiasts from all walks of life, eager to experience the boundless joy of soaring above the earth.</p></font>
        <font size="+1"><p>As their reputation grew, so did their community, each member carrying a piece of Harry and Harriet's vision into the skies. The haven became a symbol of breaking free from the ordinary, a place where every flight was a step into the vast, unexplored heavens. Today, it stands as a testament to their dream, a legacy of adventure and exploration that continues to inspire new generations of skyward souls.</p></font>
