            Here at Harry and Harriet's, we offer an immersive and vigorating skydiving experience. There are trained professionals who can skydive with customers that are more
        inexperienced. Waivers and instructions will be given in more detail after making an appointment. Making an appointment is free; however, signing up for an appointment
        and not showing up with no intent to cancel will result in a fee. To get a better idea of what is offered, you can watch this <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=IGKjX1Sw7hU"
        target = "_blank">video</a> that features a customer skydiving for the first time.
